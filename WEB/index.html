        <h3>Side Hustle?</h3>
        <p>
            Looking for a new side hustle?  Here's a really simple thing you can do: buy
            a personalized QR code from me for <b>{cost}</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your QR code will link back to this website with your id. Slap your QR code
            on anything, like custom calling cards for instance, and distribute it far and wide!
        </p>
        <p>
            You will receive <b>{payout}</b> for every new QR code that your
            QR code generates! Easy Peasy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Text <b>"{id}"</b> to <b>971-236-1579</b> to get your personalized QR code today!
        </p>

        <h3>Custom Cards</h3>
        <p>
            I also enjoy designing funny custom calling cards. I merge your info onto
            your images, or images I scrape from the internet. Maybe you are holding one right
            now!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a personalized QR code I will include it on your card design and
            your cards can earn you money as you use them!  Sweet!
        </p>
        <p>
            Text me at <b>971-236-1579</b> and we will chat about what makes you laugh!
