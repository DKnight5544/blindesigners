        <h3>Intro & Welcome!</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Dave. I have a new hobby. I am designing funny "Not For Business" cards!
            I am eager to discover what tickles your funny bone and design a unique custom card for
            you that you’ll have fun using.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plus, I want you to earn money while having fun with your cards.
            Each card comes with a QR code that links to this page.
            I'll give you <b>{payout}</b> for each new customer your card brings in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have your design, you can get some cards printed.
            I recommend <a href="https://www.VistaPrint.com" target="_blank" title="Link to VistaPrint">VistaPrint.com</a>.
            They offer a variety of quantities, paper qualities, and other options.
            I’ve always been impressed with their excellent service and quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, text me at <b>971-236-1579</b>, and we will chat about what makes you laugh. Oh, by
            the way, you were sent here by: BACON!
