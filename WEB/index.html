        <h3>It Worked!</h3>
        <p>
            You are here because someone gave you a card.
            You scanned a QR code. You're here! The system works,
            and the system can work for you too!
        </p>

        <h3>The Product</h3>
        <p>
            I make fun, custom calling cards than can make you 
            up to $25 each as you use them! 
            <b>It's a business-in-a-box!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            I make them from images you send me or from stuff I
            find on the internet that tickles your funnybone.
        </p>

        <h3>The Plan</h3>
        <p>
            I pay you a $25 referral fee for each new customer your cards generate,
            starting with your third. Let's call him Doug.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your first two referral fees are paid to the same person who
            was paid for your referral. This is called "roll-up."
        </p>

        <p>
            This means the first two referrals that Doug generates are
            paid to you, then their first two, and their first two, and so on...
        </p>

        <h3>The Magic!</h3>
        <p>
            Now, thanks to the magic of "roll-up,"
            every $25 you receive can begin to multiply
            all on its own, over and over again!
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Do This!</h3>
        <p>
            Getting started is easy: just text the phone number on the card
            you scanned to:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>971-236-1579.</b>
        </p>
