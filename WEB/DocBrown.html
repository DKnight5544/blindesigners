        <h3>It Works!</h3>
        <p>
            Great Scott, Marty! You're here because you scanned a QR code! The system works, and it can work for you too! This is heavy!
        </p>

        <h3>The Product</h3>
        <p>
            Marty, I sell custom QR codes that lead to this very page. 
            My custom QR codes cost only <b>{cost}</b> each, and you 
            can make up to <b>{payout}</b> every time someone scans it! 
            Think of the possibilities! It's like converting 1.21 
            gigawatts directly into cash!
        </p>

        <h3>The Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Here is a strategy that you can take to the bank:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, purchase a custom QR code. It's simple, like the flux capacitor!</li>
            <li>
                Then, head over to
                <a href="https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards/qr-code" target="_blank" title="Link to VistaPrint.com">VistaPrint.com</a>
                and get some cards printed with your QR code. They have many designs to choose from, like variations in the space-time continuum!
            </li>
            <li>Pass your cards out to everyone you meet. Just don't let Biff get his hands on one!</li>
            <li>
                Earn up to <b>{payout}</b> each time! Marty, we have to protect your future!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It really is that simple, Marty! Great Scott!
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Do This!</h3>
        <p id="IdContainer">
            Simply text "<b>{0}</b>", to <b>971-236-1579.</b> The future is in your hands!
        </p>
