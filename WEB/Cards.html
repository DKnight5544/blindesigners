        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm <b>"Cartman."</b></p>
        <p>
            Well, you scanned my card, so let me give you the pitch.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you like my card, you should consider getting some of your
            own made. The guys I work with get a kick out of creating these
            custom cards made from stuff they find on the internet or stuff
            you send them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can have a one-of-a-kind, "non-business" card designed for yourself
            and actually make up to {payout} apiece by handing them out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your card will come with a QR code linked to this website, and you will
            get {payout} for each new sale your card helps us generate!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what are you waiting for? Get started now by texting "<b>{id}</b>" to...
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>971-236-1579</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Heads Up:</b> My guys do design work only. You can have your cards printed anywhere
            you like, using whatever card stock you like, and print just the quantity you want.
            Personally, I recommend
