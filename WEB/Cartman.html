        <h3>It Works!</h3>
        <p>
            Alright, listen up, you guys. You're here because you scanned a QR code. The system works, okay? And it can work for you too. No messing around, alright?
        </p>

        <h3>The Product</h3>
        <p>
            So, here's the deal, man. I sell custom QR codes that lead right to this page. My custom QR codes cost <b>{cost}</b> each. And guess what? You can make up to <b>{payout}</b> every time someone scans it! That's freaking sweet, right?
        </p>

        <h3>The Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Here's the plan, and it's awesome, alright?
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you buy a custom QR code. Duh.</li>
            <li>
                Then, you go to
                <a href="https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards/qr-code" target="_blank" title="Link to VistaPrint.com">VistaPrint.com</a>
                and get some cards printed with your QR code. They've got tons of designs, okay? More than you could ever need.
            </li>
            <li>Next, you pass those cards out everywhere. Like, just throw them at people or something.</li>
            <li>And then, you earn up to <b>{payout}</b> each time! That's like getting a bunch of free snacks, you guys. Totally worth it. Just don't kill Kenny, alright?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It's really that simple, you guys! Do it now! Respect my Authoritah!
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Do This!</h3>
        <p id="IdContainer">
            So, here's what you do. Just text "<b>{0}</b>", to <b>971-236-1579.</b> Seriously, do it now, or screw you guys, I'm going home!
